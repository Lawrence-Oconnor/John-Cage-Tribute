# John Cage Tribute
Home to Team 12's Senior Design project for the Fall 2020 semester at University of Central Florida.

The John Cage Tribute is a modern-day revival of John Cage's universally acclaimed musical style.
Welcoming users of all walks of life, including avid Cage fans, experimental musicians, and more, the Tribute 
is a means by which users can emulate John Cage. This project is divided into two primary components:

## Mobile
Users may download the John Cage Tribute app (represented by the 'mobile' folder) in order to initiate the process.
From here, a 'session' may begin to allow for turning one's ambient environment into 'Cage-like' compositions, complete
with their own duration of performance specified by the session creator.

The users fall into two separate but closely linked categories:

### Performers
When the application requests users to operate as a "performer", they will use their microphones to record their
immediate surroundings. Upon doing so, the audio coming from each of these performers will be manipulated and merged together.
The performers are akin to real musical performers, using their music to form a cohesive and whole musical piece.

### Listeners
Those who opt as listeners can lend an ear to the musical piece as it is crafted in a near real-time fashion.
During the duration of the session, the audio from each performer is blended together. Segments of the final piece are
constructed, being passed to each listener in the form of a buffer.
