Instructions
Registered users or guests can view and join pending recording sessions via the Appointments tab. If the appointment's PIN was shared with them, they can choose to join its session to listen to the mixed audio or perform for it. Upon completion, the appointment maker is prompted to enter information about the result. Additionally, any user may search for compositions that were already completed, while registered users can view the compositions they've made.
