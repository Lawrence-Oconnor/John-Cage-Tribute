Instructions
Registered users or guests can view and join pending recording sessions via the Rooms tab. If the room's PIN was shared with them, they can choose to join its session to listen to the mixed audio or perform for it. Upon completion, the room host (the composer) is prompted to enter information about the result. Additionally, any user may search for compositions that were already completed via the Search tab, while registered users can also view the compositions they've made via the Library tab.
